          <h2>Hi, I am Anthony Odero!</h2>
          <p class="text-centered">I am a Software Engineer in the San Francisco Bay Area. I am currently undertaking
            the FullStack Engineering Immersion Bootcamp at Thinkful.
          </p>
          <p>With these skills I intend to develop software for Artificial Intelligence through predictive modeling.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <div class="group">
          <div class="item">
            <p>Becoming a software developer has always been my dream. However with a PhD in Environmental Sciences, I
              began my career modeling impacts of climate change adaptation and mitigation on the environment.
            <p>Whereas this was also an extremely fulfilling career, I renewed my interest in Software Engineering while
              working
              as a QA Analyst in San Francisco. I was really excited to see features that I had tested make it into
              production code. I am really glad to have finally made this step towards becoming a software developer.</p>
              
            </p>

            <p>I am learning to code in Javascript to develop websites and in Python and SQL to process and analyse datasets from relational databases.</p>
            <p> I can't wait to start building cool features with other programmers.</p>

            <p>When I am not coding I love to play basketball, bike, ride a motorcycle and write scientific articles on
              climate change and
              sustainability.</p>

            <p> I built a financial planning website simulating risk and uncertainty. The goal of this project was to
              enable users simulate their financial decisions, make informed choices and track impacts of their
              decision-making on their financial health. I'll share the skills/languages I applied to develop it.</p>
