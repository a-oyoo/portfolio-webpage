      <!-- Introducing Anthony -->
      <p>I am a Software Engineer in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>

      <!-- A little about Anthony's interests -->
      <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

      <p> I started my career as a Environmental Scientist but began transitioning to web development while working as a QA Analyst in San Francisco. I was really excited to see features that I had tested make it into production code.</p>

      <p>Becoming a software developer has always been my dream. I enjoy web products that make everyday activities simpler and more enjoyable and have always wondered how they are built. I am therefore really excited to have finally started learning how to develop as a student at Thinkful.</p>

      <p>I can't wait to collaborate with other developers to build cool and exciting software that:</p> 

      <ol>
        <li>Helps people get things done efficiently</li>
        <li>Helps people plan better </li>
        <li>Helps people track progress</li>
      </ol>

      <p>When I am not coding I love to play basketball, bike and write scientific articles on climate change and sustainability.</p>
